# MarkovChain_StockMarket

The idea of this project is to predict the future behavior of stocks on the stock market by a pre-trained Markov chain. 
The Markov chains theory is a method of making quantitative analysis about the situation in which the system transfers from one state to another, 
hence predicting future tendencies. This provides a basis for making strategic analysis.
